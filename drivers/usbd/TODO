1. Network Driver - RNDIS Support

	Add optional extension to allow the network driver to be used with
	Microsoft Windows RNDIS driver. 
	
	This requires a bus interface driver which has a complete compliment
	of endpoints (two bulk and one interrupt) and a fully featured ep0
	implementation that can read setup data packets. The Scanlogic SL11
	should work.

	A test parser for the setup packets has been written.


2. Network Driver - non safe mode

	Allow the network driver to work with generic host class drivers
	(such as usbnet, plusb etc).


3. Hitachi SuperH - implement

	Implement SuperH bus interface driver.


4. Scanlogic SL11 - port

	Port to Solutions Engine.


5. Scanlogic SL11 - bug

	Fix bug where short packets can arrive out of order.


6. Serial - CDC mode

	Add CDC mode to serial driver. Test against linux acm driver.


7. Linkup L7205/L7210 - ongoing 

	Continue to work with linkup to find problems.


8. Monitor - test

	Test the monitor module.


9. safe_net - find bug

	Find and fix bug causing occasional hangs.


10. Documentation

	Document all of the USB Device software.


11. Network Driver - early vs late 

        Optionally allow the network interface to be permanent instead of existing
        only when enumerated.
