The usbd-monitor module can be used to monitor for connection to via
the USB cable to a host or hub.

In general this facility is only useful if you also have the ability
to control the pullup resistor because once connected  with the pullup
resistor enabled the host will attempt enumeration immediately.

The module loading facilities may not be fast enough to get the usbd
support loaded before the host fails the enumeration.
