StrongARM SA-1111 USB OHCI host controller driver
Brad Parker <brad@parker.boston.ma.us>

These diffs produce a kernel which may possible allow the SA-1111 OHCI
controller to work.  I've tested it with various mice and keyboards.

The diffs are against the -test8-rmk4-np3 version of usb-ohci.c

Issues/problems:

- this patch allocates the hcca, ed's & td's from consistent memory.
Jamie's original patch was close but double frees an ED when a device
is disconnected.  there is a fix in this patch for that problem;
basically dl_del_list notices the one ed which should not be free'd
(it's the urb's ed)

- the patch works around the "A20 dma bug" in the SA-1111 by copying
buffers.  It keeps two buffer pools, 1K and 64K.  To get properly
aligned memory is allocated 2Mb of kernel pages.

- there are bugs in the SA-1111 chip which this driver works around:

1. the sound dma to be "exercised" before the DClk is enabled.  There
is code in the patch to do this.

2. the sa-1111 bus interface has a bug when its a bus master (dma).
basically if an address with A20 asserted is used the transfer won't
work and may correupt dram.

A lot of the credit for this work goes to:
